Going to go with my last candidate pitch as it still stands...
While I really appreciate the open discussion regarding all things Mobile via Discord, it truly seems that the MOBILE Working Group is speeding up some of that discussion by having passionate and engaged individuals work through issues prior to public release.  As one of those individuals, I would like to continue contributing to the Working Group's success on behalf of our project.  I believe my significant investment in equipment and installations offers confirmation of my belief in the project and the level to which I will think through any and all issues and ideas that comes before the Working Group.  Thank you for the chance to give my time and effort on behalf of the community.
