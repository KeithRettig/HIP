Although I haven't been so active with the Discord community recently, I have been a part of Helium since 2019. I started a new hosting and deployment company in 2020 called Flywheel Systems and built the business by installing hundreds of Helium IoT and then Mobile radios on roofs in the St. Louis area.
I've also leveraged my design and marketing skills for GEODNET, DIMO, and other web3 projects. I'm currently collaborating with Proof Wireless to start a new company to deploy DePIN projects in the Miami area â€” we're actively working with hosts to set up Helium Mobile radios on top of and inside of businesses like hotels and brewpubs.
I plan to bring this experience to the MOBILE Working Group.
