I am eager to continue my involvement with the Mobile Working Group because I have been an original member since its inception. My consistent attendance at every meeting reflects my dedication to the group's objectives. I take pride in actively contributing valuable ideas that have positively impacted our discussions, and my commitment extends to authoring multiple HIPs to further enhance the subdao. Being part of this group allows me to collaboratively shape and drive innovation in the mobile subdao and I look forward to continuing this impactful journey with the team.
