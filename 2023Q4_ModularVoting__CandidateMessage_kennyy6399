About 10 years ago, I had a question that I asked myself: "Why am I paying for internet? Why can't I just create my own?". I'm sure it's more complicated than that but I didn't realize that I was already thinking of a decentralized network. That question then morphed into "Why can't I provide 'this' or 'that' for myself?". And then roughly 3 years ago I stumbled upon Helium.
The whitepaper stated "Explore the potential for the delivery of 5G 60GHz+ mmWave connectivity" and I knew this is a place I wanted to be at. Admittedly I knew very little, if not anything about how any of this stuff works on a technical level. I have soaked up every piece of information members of the Helium Community have provided me. I still have a lot to learn, yes, but I can truly say that I find this technology (and learning about it over the years) fascinating. It's probably the only blockchain project that I can say "I'm in it for the tech". I would like to be a part of the MOBILE Working Group to collaborate with others to ensure a healthy and strong growth of the mobile network.
