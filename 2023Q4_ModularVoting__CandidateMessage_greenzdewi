I’d like to continue being part of the group and help shape our network to make it the success it is destined to be.  We have many changes on the horizon with the introduction of WiFi hotspots to the network.  I’d like to provide whatever insight and feedback possible from the perspective of someone who has deployed and invested in CBRS, a mobile holder and hopefully soon will begin WiFi deployments as a national plan is introduced.
Thank you for your consideration.
