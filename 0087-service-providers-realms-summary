## Summary
This HIP proposes to make specific how Service Providers are eligible for rewards from the HIP-53 specified Service Provider MOBILE Reward bucket. The proposal suggests a usage-based approach to calculate rewards for Service Providers based on the amount of Data Credits burned. Service Providers would be rewarded in MOBILE tokens at a 1:1 ratio for the burned Data Credits with proportional distribution if the total exceeds the reward bucket value.

***

## Proposal Details:
**If this proposal passes, the following changes will be made to the Helium Network:**

To prevent a scenario in which a Service Provider is rewarded the full MOBILE Service Provider Reward Bucket while burning little to no Data Credits (DC), we propose to follow a similar usage-based approach as outlined in HIP-10 for the IoT Network. We propose that Service Providers are rewarded up to 1:1 in MOBILE tokens for the amount of DC burned during a reward period, similar to the approach in HIP-10. If the Service Providers collectively burn more DC than the equivalent amount of MOBILE tokens in the Service Provider reward bucket, each Service Provider will be rewarded proportionally to its share of DC burn. If the Service Providers collectively burn less DC than the equivalent amount of MOBILE tokens, the remainder of the Service Provider bucket will not be minted.

Voting for this proposal will place your veMOBILE in support of the changes and additions outlined above.
Unless otherwise noted, the changes and additions listed above are subject to implementation by the Helium Core Developers.

**If this proposal does not pass within 7 days, then it will expire and will not have any effects on the Helium Network.**
